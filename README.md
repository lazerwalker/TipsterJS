## Tipster (Yet Another jQuery Tooltip Plugin)

This is a small JS library for creating small pop-up dialogs that refer to a parent element. You can use it to create both hover-only tooltips (a la Facebook or [Tipsy](http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/)) and more full-featured iPad-style popovers or hovercards. It's designed to be both lightweight (~4kb minified) and flexible; it's ultra-configurable, touch-friendly, and easily re-styleable via pure CSS.

Usage instructions can be found in the un-minified jquery.tooltip.js file. The included CSS/SASS provides a sane default styling for a semi-translucent black tooltip (a la Facebook or Github), including a pretty nifty hack to give the tail a drop-shadow purely in CSS; however, Tipster will function fine if you want to modify the CSS or replace it entirely.

I gladly accept pull requests.
